  Method & Min bugs & Max bugs & Avg bugs & Avg. scov\% & Avg. bcov \\
  \hline
  AFL on program only & 3 & 5 & 4.2 & 81.73\% & 80.40\%\\
  \hline
  AFL on random mutants, non-cumulative  & 6 & 7 & 6.4 & 81.70\% & 80.70\%\\

  AFL on random mutants, cumulative/sequential & 6 & 7 & 6.2 & 81.77\%

Coverage differences were not statistically significant by Mann
Whitney U test, but bug count differences between both methods and AFL
without mutants were significant with $p$-value $< 0.006$.
