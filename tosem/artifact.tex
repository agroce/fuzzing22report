\section{Overview}

\subsection{Paper}

\subsubsection{Summary.} Our paper proposes that fuzzing can in many cases be improved by
simply devoting some portion of the fuzzing budget to \emph{mutants}
of the program to be fuzzed.  We suggest our reasons for this
hypothesis, and in the original registered report showed promising
results for a small benchmark example.

\subsubsection{Key claims:}  Our key claim is that devoting 50\% of
the budget for fuzzing a program to fuzzing source code mutants of
that program can improve fuzzing outcomes.  A secondary claim is that
prioritizing mutants by some reasonable scheme (including a kind of
stratified sampling) will perform better than randomly selecting
mutants, but that either will be effective.

Our full set of research questions is;

\begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf RQ1}: Can replacing time spent fuzzing a target program with time spent fuzzing mutants of the target program, under at least one configuration, improve
    the effectiveness of fuzzing on average over a variety of target programs?
    \item {\bf RQ2:} Does using prioritization improve the effectiveness of fuzzing with mutants?  If so, which prioritizations perform best?
    \item {\bf RQ3:} How do non-cumulative (parallel) and cumulative (sequential) mutant fuzzing compare?
    \item {\bf RQ4:} How does impact of using mutants vary with the fraction of the fuzzing budget devoted to fuzzing mutants, given a good configuration based on results from {\bf RQ2} and {\bf RQ3}?
    \item {\bf RQ5:} Are certain kinds of mutants generally more useful for fuzzing, or generally not useful?  Are these patterns the same or different for new path discovery and novel bug detection?
    \end{itemize}

    Some of these are not answered in this submission, due to problems
    with FuzzBench discussed.  However, the core questions, RQ1 and
    RQ2 are both substantially addressed and confirm our hypotheses.

\subsubsection{Key results:} Using the two standard measures of fuzzer
effectiveness, FuzzBench experiments over a large set of benchmarks
substantiate our claims.  Using prioritized mutants as targets for
half of the fuzzing budget of AFLplusplus outperforms baseline
AFLplusplus and all other fuzzers applied.  Moreover, even random
selection of mutants does well by various measures, and increases
branch coverage by a large, statisticaly significant, amount for
multiple benchmarks.

Our \emph{evidence} is in the form of a FuzzBench report generated by merging
the results from a set of individual experiments (these are also just
fuzzer run data).  For convenience we
have included a DOI to a collection of all our code and data.  FuzzBench uses its own
data analysis tools, primarily from pandas and scikit, to our knowledge.
  
\section{Prerequisites and Requirements}


The core claims of our paper are based on FuzzBench
\cite{metzman2021fuzzbench}
(\url{https://google.github.io/fuzzbench/}) experiments.  There is no
prerequisite for performing experiments in this case; any experiment
submitted to Google's Cloud Servers as documented on the FuzzBench site
can include our fuzzers and compare them to other fuzzers.
To duplicate our experiments, some adjustments to FuzzBench build
timeouts may be required, as noted in the full paper.  The individual experiment
runs (if exact duplication is desired) are: \url{https://fuzzbench.com/reports/experimental/2022-10-13-um-final-1/index.html}, \url{https://fuzzbench.com/reports/experimental/2022-10-13-um-final-2/index.html}, \url{https://fuzzbench.com/reports/experimental/2022-10-13-um-final-4/index.html}, and \url{https://fuzzbench.com/reports/experimental/2022-10-13-um-final-5/index.html}.

\section{Setup}

As noted, the experiments used to substantiate our claims are based on
adding fuzzers to FuzzBench.  Links above to our individual
experiments should enable anyone to request a duplicate set of
experiments.  The FuzzBench team can assist in merging multiple
experiments into one run.

\section{Steps to Reproduce}

For our primary results, as noted, simply request a set of FuzzBench
experiments as documented
(\url{https://google.github.io/fuzzbench/}).  In the future we may
make newer versions of our fuzzers available that avoid FuzzBench
build problems, but we plan to leave our original fuzzers in place as
artifacts for this paper.  It is also possible to run local
experiments using FuzzBench fuzzers
(\url{https://google.github.io/fuzzbench/running-a-local-experiment}),
and we include the full FuzzBench release code and instructions for
using it standalone as well.
